### Objectives
 
This exercise addresses questions like:

1. How two different species compete for a food resource, if their food resources are overlapped? And how can be these dynamics incorporated into a simulator using mathematically defined equations?

2. And how they coexist in the same habitat even if competition seems to exist all the time?
